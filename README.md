Project Overview
--
For our project, we focused on following the data engineering process to extract, transform, and load restaurant data. Firstly, we extracted data from websites including Yelp and Foursquare using API connections as well as sourced data from a large dataset provided by Yelp. Secondly, we transformed the data we collected by dropping null values, changed the data types of several columns and selected specific attributes to insert data into DataFrames. Third, we created an Entity Relationship Diagram with the schema from our DataFrames and used them to load the data tables into a PostgreSQL database. Lastly, we used our DataFrames to create Leaflet map and used SQLAlchemy to pull our database data into Jupyter Notebook to store it for future use.
